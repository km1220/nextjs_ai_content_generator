In previous studies, few illicit pharmacies selling buprenorphine were found, relative to the number of pharmacies selling other opioids (Forman et al., 2006).

We examined one hundred links for each Internet search performed in the current study, as in previous research, but the number of links a typical user would examine is unknown. In addition, as we did not actually purchase buprenorphine from the illicit pharmacies identified, we could not determine whether the product would be delivered as advertised and whether it would be suitable for human consumption. Despite this, successful delivery seems reasonably possible as a similar study revealed that 10 of 11 (91%) online orders placed for oxycodone and hydrocodone without a prescription were received (United States General Accounting Office, 2004).",
